# Networks-Notes

These are my personal notes on the lectures provided by the Paul G. Allen School's Au20 offering of [Computer Networks](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse461/20au/) and Tanebaum/Wetherall's "Computer Networks - Fifth Edition". As such, there are bound to be errata or lacking explanations. Please feel free to open an issue or pull request if you find any. I have written these notes using a [markdown preview](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview-plus) package for Atom, which enabled the use of both markdown and LaTex, which I felt were both excellent visualization tools.
